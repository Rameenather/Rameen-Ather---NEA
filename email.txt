Dont forget your basics 
Just log on today for free and revise
Daily reminder to revise :D
I know its annoying but you gotta work for that grade!
Check your progress in your topics, has it changed? log it then!
Got a few minutes to spare, well i have a couple of questions to spare
Forgetting to do something today?
Please revise the end results are fruitful 
Daily consistant revision is better than cramming everything into one day
Try a few questions and maybe you'll find something you dont get
Want to get into uni? well you gotta work for it!
Revising everyday is good but so is taking consistant breaks, work but dont over work.
Remember to sleep at a normal time people doing alevel should be getting atleast 8 hours of sleep
